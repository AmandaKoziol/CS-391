# CS 391 Final Project

To run, add a `config.py` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the project directory and enter `python app.py` in the project terminal

# Open AI Prompts Used to Generate Book App
1. Give me code for a Flask app for a book app that has the following features:
    - Lists current books the user is reading 
    - Lists books the user has read 
    - Lists recommended books based on the user's reading history 
    - User can upload a book from a text file
    - When reading a book, the user can read along with an audio file
    - When reading a book, an image is displayed for the page the user is on 
    - The user can mark books as read and reread books 
    - The user can edit or delete uploaded books
2. Make the Flask app pretty
3. *Additional prompts to fix formatting*

# Generated Code for Each Prompt
1. app.py (without Open AI calls) and html files
2. css file

# Modifications I Made to the Generated Code
1. Added Open AI API calls to app.py
2. Removed or modified code that broke the app
