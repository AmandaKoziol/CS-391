lsvnc2y,reddevils,1g84ky1,0.9,">*‚ÄúDo you know who the worst one was? Park Ji-sung. He was a nightmare! He was unbelievable. He just used to come up to me, look at me and not say a word, stand right next to me‚Ä¶ 'Oh Jesus, here we go!' 'Just say something to me, have a laugh with me!'  But he was unbelievable at it. He just used to come and stare right into my face, stare right into my eyes, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not getting a kick today.'‚Äù*    

&nbsp; - Paul Scholes


>*‚ÄúYour job today is not about touching the ball, it‚Äôs not about making passes, your job is Pirlo. That‚Äôs all. Pirlo.""*    

&nbsp; - Sir Alex Ferguson


>*‚Äú[Sir Alex] is a man without blemish, but he ruined that purity just for a moment when it came to me.  A fleeting shabbiness came over the legend that night. At Milan, he unleashed Park Ji-sung to shadow me.  [Park] rushed about at the speed of an electron. He‚Äôd fling himself at me, his hands all over my back, trying to intimidate me.  He‚Äôd look at the ball and not know what it was for. They‚Äôd programmed him to stop me. His devotion to the task was almost touching. Even though he was a famous player, he consented to being used as a guard dog.""*

&nbsp; - Andrea Pirlo


>*""I‚Äôm sure Pirlo woke up the next morning, looked at the bottom of his bed and expected to see Ji-sung Park there.  He was that good.‚Äù*

&nbsp; - Rio Ferdinand


>*""Sir Alex Ferguson made me man-mark Pirlo...When he had the ball, I tried to prevent him passing the ball in front of him. To mark Pirlo was not easy. It was hard - mentally and physically - but consequently, Milan had a difficult game against us.""*

This lad was a rock in his defensive/ game control and organisation role. 

But the influence he had overall that number of assists and goals scored and how he impacted his side were a on a level of a  Ballon d'Or highest standards.

This one and Cannavaro's after the 2006 WC are probably the less flashy winners in the last 20 years. Maybe sure.

Ronaldinho did absolute magic and made people foam from the mouth in awe every 4 days at his very best yes.

Sure we all like attack minded football, celebrate and praise when a generational talent bangs in 50 goals in a season. The gong is well deserved in that case 100%

Rodri and Cannavaro's were two brutally legendary performances of two defensive footballers.

They played at the peak of their powers and their craft in their Ballon  d'Or seasons. They had an influence of such magnitude on their sides achieving a WC and a Euro. 

Spain was an utter shambles of a side before the last Euro. And this lad was a pillar in that champion side.

ltwn6la,Everton,1gcrs8s,0.9,"Say what you want but this is great for the team. Guys fighting for their place in the squad and the 11 and making the most of their chances.

Very very good for morale and overall competition."
ltxl4gs,Everton,1gcrs8s,0.9,"First of all, bravo to the OP: this is one of the best headlines I‚Äôve ever read üòäüëèüèº 

I‚Äôm happy for Beto as his passion has won me over like it has others, and I feel bad for him that Dyche has been stubborn with his system instead of experimenting to make the most of Beto, even if DCL is better overall. Now, if only we could pair Beto‚Äôs passion with Dom‚Äôs overall game, we‚Äôd have a world-beater üòùü§ûüèº"
lu4pf72,Everton,1gcrs8s,-0.6,He is so under rated while DCL is so overrated. Dyche is afraid to make bold calls.
ltxpwu0,Everton,1gcrs8s,1.0,Long Live the King!
ltzm8fg,Everton,1gcrs8s,0.7,Would like us to find a way to play two up front with Beto & DCL. Think Keane being up front with Beto helped give their defence something else to think about but when DCL was up front alone he had two defenders on him all the time
lu09wlm,Everton,1gcrs8s,0.25,"I love Beto, but I don't think he has earned the starting spot. He is a fine super sub and a chaos agent against tired defenses. And he has the height to score goals like this one. But just watch him play - he puts in a ton of effort, but his fundamentals aren't there. He misses a lot of easy passes and his control is not good enough to play hold up. He is great to throw on exactly like Dyche did today against a tired team. He ran a ton, and his chaotic challenges and erratic movement actually seemed to work in our favor. He seems unpredictable to play against. Good on him and I hope he continues to make an impact off the bench, but Dom is so much more polished and it's clear. He'll get back into form, he played fine today"
lspnqiz,Everton,1g7db0w,0.6,"I was annoyed seeing him on the teamsheet today, but he proved me wrong."
lsptxod,Everton,1g7db0w,0.5,"He‚Äôs not good enough, but after he‚Äôs gone (whenever that might be) I‚Äôm going to choose to remember some of the great goals he‚Äôs scored rather than his poor defending. That Palace goal will live long in the memory."
lsqs377,Everton,1g7db0w,-0.6,Whoever scouted him as a defender has just denied us the greatest English goal scorer ever.
lsq8nrn,Everton,1g7db0w,-0.6,"I mean; its good to see, i just hope its permenant, because efc have seen this a ton

Keane plays well for two or three games,

Drops 11 stinkers in a row"
lsq3pd7,Everton,1g7db0w,0.4,When he makes it to five this season I‚Äôll buy a kit
lsqkerg,Everton,1g7db0w,0.6,"Look, he‚Äôs been shit for the last 1.5 years or so, but he was solid when we needed him to be early on with us. He played through an injury where he could have lost his foot. He‚Äôs scored MANY crucial goals that have helped us stay in the prem. I am all about his redemption arc."
lspuaz6,Everton,1g7db0w,0.2,"Credit where credit is due, but he has to be consistent. When he's good, he's very good but he has too many scary games."
lsqbr9j,Everton,1g7db0w,0.5,Play him upfront
lsq0jxk,Everton,1g7db0w,0.1,Everyone knew who had written this post before clicking onto it
lsr88sd,Everton,1g7db0w,0.5,Keane is the man
lstvunb,Everton,1g7x4f7,0.3,"If he was quick he'd genuinely be a striker. He's always been good on the ball in fairness, his long passing is really good. Just wish he could actually defend. If he could get a move to a team that plays in a back 3 maybe it would help."
lstz11x,Everton,1g7x4f7,0.5,Target man
lsu6yvs,Everton,1g7x4f7,0.9,I am always very happy when he does well
lsv2hdr,Everton,1g7x4f7,0.6,I'm sure some people are going to get annoyed with the Keane memes. I am not one of those people.

lsty40q,Everton,1g7x4f7,0.6,I like how you put Dixie‚Äôs curls on him.
lsx4j5h,Everton,1g7x4f7,0.0,Mixie Keane was right there

lv108ra,NUFC,1ghxpyh,-0.9,"Havertz is such an annoying cheating prick and sums up this Arsenal side. Constantly running into opponents with sly elbows and shoulder charges, doesn't go for the ball when it's in the air instead tries to hurt the opponent who is jumping for the ball, always looking to get his studs into the opponents, etc, and it's all done in a snide and sly manner where it's not blatant enough to be called a foul. Just a nasty POS and like I said it's how this Arsenal side operate. Glad to see our Brazilians boys and even Pope at one stage not put up with this twats antics."
lv1ari5,NUFC,1ghxpyh,0.5,Looks like a Dudley Boyz 3D if anyone remembers that..
lv2t94r,NUFC,1ghxpyh,-0.9,"That photo makes it look like Havertz was the victim. What actually happened was the dirty cheating prick launched in with his elbow out and Bruno just stepped out the way so Havertz went over the top. 

And then fell to the ground clutching his face like he‚Äôd been fouled. 

Arsehole. 


I don‚Äôt actually have much against most of the Arsenal squad. Arteta‚Äôs a whinging dickhead, but the rest are fine. 

Apart from Havertz and Partey, who are scum."
